# BIDS Applications

As you all learned in the [heudiconv and BIDS tutorial](https://github.com/juliagoolia28/UD_repronim/blob/master/heudiconv_tutorial/README.md), Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specifies a reproducible and consistent directory structure for all your neuroimaging data.  This allows scientists from all over the world to have a uniform data structure for all their data, enabling greater availability of user-friendly data sharing.  For an introduction to this formatting, you should visit their [website](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/). For a comprehensive overview on what BIDS formatting is and how it can be used, please see the video below.

Given the importance and usefulness of this data structure, many scientists collaborated together to create applications to preprocess, analyze, and/or visualize data that uses BIDS formatting. These applications are referred to as BIDS apps. For a comprehensive view of these BIDS apps, I would highly recommend you read the [Gorgolewski et al. (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209#abstract1) article on the creation of these applications.  This article introduces a data framework allowing for the creation and use of applications built towards analyzing various neuroimaging data that are in BIDS format.  You can also view their current list of [available BIDS apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/) and visit their [github page](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps).   

# FmriPrep

## What is FmriPrep?
In 2016, a seminal article written by [Eklund, Nichols and Knutsson](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/28/7900.full.pdf) brought to light the reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and pointed out some important oversights, inaccuracies, and areas of improvement for many neuroimaging softwares.  In response, the scientific world sought to improve and correct the preprocessing of data. Arguably one of the most frequently used BIDS apps is FmriPrep, which is an automated pipeline you can use to preprocess your data in a responsible, transparent, and reproducible fashion.  Personally, I cannot say enough good things about this incredibly useful resource.  Basically, it combines all the best functions from neuroimaging softwares such as Freesurfer, FSL, Afni and ANTS to provide you with the most scientifically rigorous and consistent manner to preprocess your data.  Plus, it allows you to select (or deselect) any specific functions in order to tailor this pipeline to your data, if need be.  It also provides beautiful visualizations of each of the steps taken to preprocess your data so you can easily inspect your data.  This includes a before and after view of your data before preprocessing and after any corrections/preprocessing steps have been taken.   To gain a comprehensive understanding of this program, I would recommend that you read their article on FmriPrep and follow instructions in their [handbook](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) which includes everything you need to know about the pipeline.  Then, I would recomend you follow the steps outlined below.
